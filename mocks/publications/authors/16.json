Last year, she led engagement and reported for the Lost Mothers series which illuminated a national disgrace: The U.S. has the worst rate of maternal deaths in the developed world, and up to 60 percent of those deaths are preventable. This series was the 2018 winner of the Goldsmith Prize for Investigative Reporting and received the George Polk Award in the medical reporting category.<br><br>Gallardo has long specialized in community journalism. Prior to ProPublica, she oversaw a reporting series at 15 public and NPR member stations. In 2014, she travelled the country with the StoryCorps mobile booth collecting over 400 stories archived at the Library of Congress. In her hometown Chicago, she spent over a decade working as a journalist and radio producer. She co-founded the Vocalo Storytelling workshop at Chicago Public Media and managed youth media programs at community-based organizations in the west and south sides of Chicago.",
