              "text": "His professional career started at Tokuma Shoten, joining the company shortly after graduation. He was assigned to the planning department of Asahi Geino, entertainment, magazine, where he was responsible for the manga coverage page. Here he had a long anticipated meeting with cartoonist Shigeru Sugiura. In 1973 he became the editor of the magazine's supplement <em>Comic &amp; Comic</em> (コミック&amp;コミック <em>komiku &amp; komiku</em>), for which he worked with and befriends film directors, such as Sadao Nakajima, Eiichi Kudo and Teruo Ishii, as well as animators and <em>manga artists</em>, like Osamu Tezuka, George Akiyama, Kazuo Kamimura, Hōsei Hasegawa (ja) and Shotaro Ishinomori. During a hiatus of the comic supplement he was reassigned to the performing arts feature section of <em>Asahi Geino</em>, for which he covered such varied topics as <em>Bōsōzoku</em>, Japanese motorcycle gangs, and the bombing of the headquarters of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries by the East Asia Anti-Japan Armed Front. From this period he has mentioned Sayuri Ichijō (ja) as a memorable person. In 1975 Suzuki was assigned to the editorial department of the monthly Television Land (ja). One of the series he worked on is <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wakusei_Robo_Danguard_Ace\">Wakusei Robo Danguard Ace</a></em>. In 1978 he became an editor for the, newly created, monthly magazine <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animage\">Animage</a></em>, under its first editor-in-chief Hideo Ogata."

Suzuki and Miyazaki encountered each other again after the release of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Castle_of_Cagliostro\">The Castle of Cagliostro</a> when Suzuki again approached Miyazaki for an <em>Animage</em> article. This time the meetings result in an enduring collaborative relationship. In July 1981 Suzuki unsuccessfully pitched Miyazaki's original idea for an animated story, <em>Warring States Demon Castle</em> (戦国魔城 <em>Sengoku ma-jō</em>). The Miyazaki article, <em>Hayao Miyazaki, World of Romance and Adventure (宮崎駿 冒険とロマンの世界 <em>Miyazaki Hayao bōken to roman no sekai</em>)</em>, was published in the August 1981 issue of <em>Animage</em> magazine.&nbsp;About the issue Suzuki has stated: \"here is where it all started\".&nbsp;Suzuki was among those who facilitated the creation and publication of Miyazaki's manga, <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausica%C3%A4_of_the_Valley_of_the_Wind_(manga)\">Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind</a></em>. He was instrumental in getting the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausica%C3%A4_of_the_Valley_of_the_Wind_(film)\"><em>Nausicaä</em></a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime\">anime</a> made and helped establish Studio Ghibli after the film's release. The film was released on March 11, 1984. Studio Ghibli was founded in June 1985. Miyazaki has stated, \"If it were not for Mr. Suzuki, there wouldn't have been Studio Ghibli.\" Ghibli co-founder Takahata, producer on the Nausicaä film, has acknowledged the pivotal role of Suzuki in bringing the Nausicaä manga series into the world and used nearly identical words as Miyazaki to acknowledge Suzuki’s essential role in the creation of Studio Ghibli. Takahata also credits Suzuki for his steadfast support of Miyazaki and has cited Suzuki’s responsibility for making his friendship with Miyazaki endure."
