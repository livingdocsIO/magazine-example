The couple go through life's milestones surrounded by crabs, insects and a vast ocean."

Miyazaki showed him the short film <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Father_and_Daughter_(film)\">Father and Daughter</a></em> and asked him to find its director, Michaël Dudok de Wit, with the prospect of co-producing a feature film. Wild Bunch approached Dudok de Wit in London and convinced him to take on the project. The screenplay was written by Dudok de Wit and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascale_Ferran\">Pascale Ferran</a>."
