        "text": "In 1981 Hisaishi, with his new name, released his first album of art music, <em>MKWAJU</em>, and in 1982 the electropop-minimalist album <em>Information</em>. Then, in 1983, Hisaishi was recommended by Tokuma, who had published <em>Information</em>, to create an image album for <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausica%C3%A4_of_the_Valley_of_the_Wind_(film)\">Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind</a></em>. Hisaishi and the director of the animated film, Hayao Miyazaki, became great friends and would work together on many future projects. Their collaborations has invited comparisons to the collaborations of Steven Spielberg and John Williams. This big break led to Hisaishi's overwhelming success as a composer of film scores. In 1986, <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laputa:_Castle_in_the_Sky\">Laputa: Castle in the Sky</a></em>, and later, in the 1990s, <em>Porco Rosso</em> and <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Mononoke\">Princess Mononoke</a></em> were released. As Hisaishi strengthened his reputation as one of the budding anime industry's top musical contributors, his compositions (including eight theatrical films and one <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_video_animation\">OAV</a>) would proceed to become some of the very hallmarks of early anime in the 1980s and 1990s. Hisaishi also composed for such TV and movie hits as <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sasuga_no_Sarutobi&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\">Sasuga no Sarutobi</a></em>, <em>Two Down Full Base</em>, <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tonde_Mon_Pe&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\">Tonde Mon Pe</a></em> and the anime <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Techno_Police_21C\"><em>Tekuno porisu 21C</em></a> (all 1982), <em>Sasuraiger</em> (1983), <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futari_Daka\">Futari Taka</a></em> (1984), <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hon%C5%8D_no_Alpen_Rose:_Judy_%26_Randy\"><em>Honō no Alpen Rose</em></a> (1985) and <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wonderful_Wizard_of_Oz_(1986_TV_series)\">Oz no mahôtsukai</a></em> (1986). He also scored the sci-fi adventure series <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mospeada\">Mospeada</a></em> (1983), which was later reworked (without his music) into the third segment of Carl Macek's compilation, <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotech\">Robotech</a></em>. Other films he scored included <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_Suit_Gundam\">Mobile Suit Gundam Movie II: Soldiers of Sorrow</a></em>(1981), <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_Suit_Gundam\">Mobile Suit Gundam Movie III: Encounters in Space</a></em>, (1982), <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_(anime)\">Birth (Bâsu)</a></em> (1984), <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arion_(anime)\">Arion</a></em> (1986), <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot_Carnival\">Robot Carnival</a></em> (1987), <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Neighbor_Totoro\">Totoro</a></em> (1988), <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crest_of_the_Royal_Family\">Crest of the Royal Family</a></em> and <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maison_Ikkoku\">Maison Ikkoku – Apartment Fantasy</a></em> (both 1988), <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus_Wars\">Venus Wars</a></em> (1989), <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiki%27s_Delivery_Service\">Kiki's Delivery Service</a></em> (1989), <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porco_Rosso\">Porco Rosso</a></em> (1992) and <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_Heaven\">Ocean Heaven</a></em> (2010). He also did theme song arrangements and composed other anime opening, closing, and insert title theme songs such as <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lalabel\">Mahō Shōjo Lalabel</a></em> (1980), <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello!_Sandybell\">Hello!
