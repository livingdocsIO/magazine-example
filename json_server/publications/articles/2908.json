Studio Ghibli digitally animated portions of the paintings and integrated original elements into the scenery. There are eight separate segments, each featuring a different painting or landscape and instrumental musical piece. The OVA focuses mostly on static shots of \"moving\" scenery: Inoue's paintings digitally altered, so that grass moves in the wind, people walk, etc. There is no dialogue."
