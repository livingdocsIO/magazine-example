One of them wants to buy a plot of land he's heard of. When they hear the sound of a horse, the others walk away to investigate, leaving the farmer who wanted to buy the land alone. He falls asleep and dreams he's talking to plants and trees, asking them about the plot of land. Eventually, the others return, and because the sun has come up, they get ready for work."
